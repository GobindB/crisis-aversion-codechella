#TODO: @Rachel needs to build her model and use it here
# 1. chose which features you want from the tweet object
# 2. create a functional model that returns a validity score as a percentage i.e 0<x<100
# 3. In the model create evalution logic and define rules by which the model evaluates
# 4. for the model this doesent matter but the data is stored in an AWS RDBMS in case you want 
#    context and location specific tweets to use as data
